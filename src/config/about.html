<h2>This digital archival experience contains historical photographs from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA).</h2>

<p>NARA acknowledges that photographs included in this project may evoke memories or feelings from a history of
  oppression.</p>

<h2>This is a living project that will continue to grow and evolve as NARA digitizes more photographs from the BIA
  records</h2>

<p>Therefore, some Tribal Nations, topics, and geographic areas may not be fully represented. As NARA digitizes and
  makes
  more photographs publicly accessible, they will be made available through this project.</p>

<h2>Captions for, and the terms used to describe, the photographs in these records were created at about the time each
  image
  was captured.</h2>

<p>Some of the terms used at the time may now be considered to be outdated, inaccurate, derogatory, disrespectful, or
  culturally insensitive. NARA does not alter, edit, or modify original captions, as they are part of the historical
  record and reflect and document the standard language, attitudes, and biases at the time.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Are all of BIA photos digitized?</h3>

<p>No. The National Archives is working to digitize its holdings. Newly digitized BIA photographs will be added to this
  guide as they are added to the National Archives Catalog.</p>

<h3>I’m looking for a photograph I know is from the National Archives, but can’t find it in the guide. Why not?</h3>

<p>This guide is limited to photographs from the records of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA, Record Group 75). There
  are many other images of Native Americans in our holdings which were taken, collected or maintained by other federal
  agencies. To access those images, search the National Archives Catalog. You may also wish to consult the web page of
  the
  <a href="https://www.archives.gov/research/still-pictures/native-americans">Still Pictures Branch</a>, which includes
  a list of highlighted images of Native Americans from multiple record groups.</p>

<h3>I would like to know more about a photograph or information in this finding aid. Is there someone who can help me?
</h3>

<p>We encourage you to post your questions to <a href="https://historyhub.history.gov/welcome">History Hub!</a></p>

<h3>How can I contribute to this finding aid?</h3>

<p>Topics were tagged by citizen archivists in the <a
    href="https://www.archives.gov/citizen-archivist/missions/bia-photographs">Native American Photographs Tagging
    Mission</a>. You can participate in
  tagging photographs by <a href="https://catalog.archives.gov/registration">registering for a National Archives
    Catalog account</a> and becoming a citizen archivist too!</p>

<h3>Why can’t I find records by date?</h3>

<p>Many of these images are undated, or associated with a very broad date range. In the limited cases where a date is
  available, it is included with the photograph’s item description.</p>

<h3>I’m interested in a particular state/tribe/topic, but can’t find any images. Why not?</h3>

<p>The Bureau of Indian Affairs did not take or maintain images associated with all states, tribes or topics. When it
  did take or maintain images, not all of them were retained with information identifying the state, tribe or topic.
  This
  guide provides access to digitized Bureau of Indian Affairs photographs, which do not represent all of the Bureau of
  Indian Affairs photographs in the custody of the National Archives. The guide will be updated as additional images
  are digitized - you may wish to check periodically to see if images relevant to your area of interest are added at a
  later date.</p>
