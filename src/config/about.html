<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Are all of BIA photos digitized?</h3>

<p>No. The National Archives is working to digitize its holdings. Newly digitized BIA photographs will be added to this
  guide as they are added to the National Archives Catalog.</p>

<h3>I’m looking for a photograph I know is from the National Archives, but can’t find it in the guide. Why not?</h3>

<p>This guide is limited to photographs from the records of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA, Record Group 75). There
  are
  many other images of Native Americans in our holdings which were taken, collected or maintained by other federal
  agencies. To access those images, search the National Archives Catalog. You may also wish to consult the web page of
  the
  <a href="https://www.archives.gov/college-park/photographs">Still Pictures Branch</a>, which includes a list of
  highlighted images of Native Americans from multiple record groups.</p>

<h3>I’m stuck and I don’t know where to begin. Is there an archivist who can help me?</h3>

<p>We encourage you to post your questions to <a href="https://historyhub.history.gov/welcome">History Hub!</a></p>

<h3>I have information on a record I see. Who should I share it with?</h3>

<p>We encourage researchers to add tags to records by <a href="https://catalog.archives.gov/registration">registering
    for an account</a> with the National Archives Catalog. You
  are also welcome to contact the custodial unit responsible for the images. The contact information for the custodial
  unit can be found in the “Contacts” section of the item page in the National Archives Catalog.</p>

<h3>Why can’t I find records by date?</h3>

<p>Many of these images are undated, or associated with a very broad date range. In the limited cases where a date is
  available, it is included with the photograph’s item description.</p>

<h3>I’m interested in a particular state/tribe/topic, but can’t find any images. Why not?</h3>

<p>The Bureau of Indian Affairs did not take or maintain images associated with all states, tribes or topics. When it
  did
  take or maintain images, not all of them were retained with information identifying the state, tribe or topic. This
  guide provides access to digitized Bureau of Indian Affairs photographs, which do not represent all of the Bureau of
  Indian Affairs photographs in the custody of the National Archives. The guide will be updated as additional images are
  digitized - you may wish to check periodically to see if images relevant to your area of interest are added at a later
  date.</p>
